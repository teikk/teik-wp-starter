### Why did I use this?

* Includes Bootstrap SCSS files
** I was tired of overwriting bootstrap classes over and over again making my css file longer
* Modified Menu Walker for my own workflow
** I didn't like the default WordPress menu classes so I removed all of them
** Not many of my clients liked the default Bootstrap mobile menu so I decided to stop using it and wrote more modern approach
